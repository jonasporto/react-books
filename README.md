React Books
===========

A demonstration of a simple React + Redux application. It fetches metadata from the Google Books API.

Demo it here: [React Books App](https://pashasc.github.io/react_books/ "React Books App")

This app uses webpack for compiling javaScript written in ES6 format and running a dev server. Simply install the npm packages, ```npm install```. Then run a server, ```npm run server``` and visit ```http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/```.

Whats different about React
===========================

**You update the UI by updating the state.**

Using jQuery you might write some code like this to show or hide an element.

    $('.element').on('click', function (event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      var $dropdown = $(this).closest('.my-dropdown');

      if ($dropdown.is(':visible')) {
        $dropdown.hide();
      }
      else {
        $dropdown.show();
      }
    });

In React the parts of your interface are broken up into components. A component returns the html it should show based on itâ€™s state.

Simply changing the state of a component will cause it to re-render and show the new state, completely handled by React, with no action on your part.

So the above familiar bit of jQuery might look like this in React.

    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    export default class MyDropDown extends Component {
      constructor () {
        super();

        this.state = {
          'is_hidden': true
        }

        this.showDropdown = this.showDropdown.bind(this);
        this.hideDropdown = this.hideDropdown.bind(this);
      }

      showDropdown (event) {
        this.setState({ 'is_hidden': false });
      }

      hideDropdown (event) {
        this.setState({ 'is_hidden': true });
      }

      render () {
        return (
          {!this.state.is_hidden &&
          <div className="my-dropdown">
            <div>Dropdown text</div>
            <a href="#"
              onClick={this.hideDropdown}>
            Hide Dropdown
            </a>
          </div>}
          {this.state.is_hidden &&
          <a href="#"
            onClick={this.showDropdown}>
          Show Dropdown
          </a>}
        )
      }
    }


Explanation of app structure
============================

1. **/components**

    Components will make up the parts of your application. They are divided between container components and the rest of the components.

    Container components are smart components. They will deal with state and manage the other components that they render, pass props or callbacks into. 

    Container components listen to state updates via Redux Connect. They automatically pick up state changes which they pass down to their 'child' components as props. 

    The rest of the components should be 'dumb' or 'presentational' components. This way they are reusable, so they shouldn't handle much state.

2. **/modules**

    Modules are the parts of the application which deal with state. They are self-contained units which should expose public functions in index.js for other parts of the application.

    A module will usually contain these files.

    1. **actionTypes.js**
    2. **actions.js** 

        The only way to mutate state in a react app is to emit an action. An action is a plain javaScript object which describes what happened. ActionTypes are kinds of actions.

    3. **reducer.js**

        Reducers maintain a state tree in redux. Reducers are pure functions which do not mutate / change state but rather create a copy of a new state. 

    3. **api.js**

        Functions that facilitate network requests should go in the API file. These functions use Redux Thunk Async Actions to perform requests, dispatch the state of the request then store the response.


3. **store.js**

    This file should contain a Redux store of all the reducers.

4. **app.js**

    Initialize your application in this file.

5. **router.js**

    Create routes in this file. Use Reacts router <Link> to create links that use routes. It is best practice to use routes for displaying pages of content so that people can link to them and the browser history (back button) works for them.
